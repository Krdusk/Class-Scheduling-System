## Project Requirements:
This project fulfills all required objectives:
1. Input Handling – Accepts user input via Scanner.  
2. Data Storage – Utilizes a HashMap to store and organize schedule data.  
3. Core Operations – Supports insertion, search, deletion, traversal, and editing.  
4. Clear Output – Displays all results in a formatted, readable table.  

---

## Limitations:
- Data is stored temporarily (not saved after closing the program).  
- Does not include automatic time or room conflict detection.  
- Single-user mode only; no student or database integration.  
- Console-based interface (no GUI support).  
- Requires manual data entry.  
- No export or print feature for schedules.  

---

## Future Improvements:
- Add permanent file storage and loading features.  
- Implement conflict detection for overlapping schedules.  
- Create a graphical interface using JavaFX or Swing.  
- Integrate database connectivity (e.g., MySQL) for multi-user data storage.  
- Include report generation (PDF or CSV format).

## Conclusion:
The Class Scheduling System applies fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms concepts by using a HashMap to simulate a real-world class management process.  
It demonstrates the efficiency of data organization, retrieval, and manipulation, serving as an academic foundation for more complex scheduling and management systems in the future.
